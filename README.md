Hey! Before we go any further, I would like to ask you a couple of questions:

-  Do you need a bit more spice in your development life?
-  Are Light or Dark themes your thing?
-  Is your tolerance for all things moe, high?
-  Do you like stickers?
-  Is having a lot of choices a must?

Well look no further friend, **I've got what you are looking for!**

With over 10 themes (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find one that fits your mood for the day.

Variety is the spice of life! So you can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba

Too distracted by the sticker in the corner of your IDE?
No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something


**Enjoy!**
