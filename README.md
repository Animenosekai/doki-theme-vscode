## About!

With well over **10 themes** (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find a theme that fits your mood for the day.

Variety is the spice of life! So you can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba
- DanganRonpa

Too distracted by the sticker in the corner of your IDE?
No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.
