## About!

Hey! Before we go any further, I would like to ask you a couple of questions:

-  Do you need a bit more spice in your development life?
-  Are Light or Dark themes your thing?
-  Is your tolerance for all things moe, high?
-  Do you like stickers?
-  Is having a lot of choices a must?

Well look no further friend, **I've got what you are looking for!**

With over 10 themes (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find one that fits your mood for the day.

You can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba

Too distracted by the sticker in the corner of your IDE?
No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.
